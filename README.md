# Image-Spatial-Index-Complexity-Calculation
This code can be used to calculate Spatial Index (Complexity Measure) of an image or dataset. This can be helpful in identifying how complex a scene or a particular image is. 

This is a standard code (not written by me) that is typically used to calculate the Spatial Index. I hae added features where this code will iterate over all the subfolders and print the result in a Xlsx file. 

In this code, we are calculating the Mean of SI as it is identidifed as a piramry identifying and classifying factor for evaluation of SI as compared to standard deviation or average.
